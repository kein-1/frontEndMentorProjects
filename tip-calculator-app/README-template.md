## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

-Retrieving the value from our input with event object target.value. Initially I wasn't 
sure how to immediately update the text as soon as the user types in the bill 
-Had trouble fitting the left and right items the same height. I used "align-self:stretch" to fix it
-Had trouble aligning the icon with the input text. I set the icon as the background, and then used background-repeat: none. Then to include it with the padding, i used "background-origin" 
-I thought the javscript wasn't too bad. I just used the event object and returned
the button value (which i assigned in HTML) as the tip multiplier
-I used target.value to get the value inside the input text 
-Utilized border-box to fit the contents. Border-box includes the padding and the 
borders. If we specifiy a width of 100%, boxborder accounts for the border and width within the element. I used this technique to fit the input tab to be the width of the full parent div. I set it to width of 100%, which accounts for the borders/padding from the parent div

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
```js
billTotal.addEventListener("input", (e) => {

    // console.log(e.target.value)
    
    // e.target.value is used to target the value we input in our <input> element
    // which we grabbed 
    totalVal.innerText = e.target.value
    total = e.target.value
    // console.log(document.querySelector(':focus'))
    console.log(total)
})
