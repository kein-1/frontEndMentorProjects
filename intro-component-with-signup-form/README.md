# Frontend Mentor - Intro component with sign up form

![Design preview for the Intro component with sign up form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this introductory component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

-Toughest part was figuring out how to use setInterval function and how to stop it. I realized that setInterval returns an ID. So we can use a global variable to keep track of how long the countdown has been running and then when that variable hits 0, we call the clearInterval() with the ID returned by setInterval  
-To get the countdown to change, I used document.getElementByID for each div and updated the values with each setInterval call  
-I used moment.diff() to take the difference between the future moment object date and the current moment() object date. The values are returned as days, hours, minutes, and seconds  

-Used Node.js (Npm) to store a browser-styled Moment.min.js file, which I included with a script tag in my HTML file  
-I wanted to use import with Moment but I didn't know or couldn't figure out how to do it without Webpack. Thus, I had to include it as a script tag. I put it before my main index.js script since it will load before my index.js runs, hence I can refer to it in my index.js  
-Used npm to run scripts to upload to github  


### Built with

-HTML/CSS/JS
-Moment.js

### What I learned

-Used setInterval for the first time. Javascript timer are all in milliseconds  
-Used Moment.js, a popular JS package that deals with date and time  
-Centering elements: I realized for position: absolute, top 50% means the item's top edge will be shifted down based on 50% of the container's height. This means the element won't necessarily be cenetered  
-Remember with translate, it uses the element's dimensions while using top,left etc with position:absolute will use the parent's dimensions  
-To center things with position and translate, remember we must translate(-X) and (-Y) 50% of its height and width BECAUSE it is the edge of the item that is 50% from the parent container. We need to move this backwards. The edge and the midpoint of the item is 50% of its own width/height!  
-Really my first time using CSS Psudoelements :before and :after. These are basically style elements without using HTML. We must include a "content" attribute.
