## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data for the chart in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to dynamically add the bars if you choose.

Your users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- Javascript


### What I learned

-Utilized SASS for this project. I barely used any of its features though; I was primarily testing with it
-Learned to run a script using NPM. With SASS, i ran a watch script. For SASS, it works by compiling .scss code to vanilla css. I utilized NPM on my command line to do so
-Learned to run node scripts using "npm init -y" which produces a package.json file. This package is where the script is 
-Learned more about flexbox in this case. I realized for flexbox, the align-item attribute only works if there is a height provided
-Learned about css vh unit which is a relative unit. 100vh means 100% of the viewport height
-Utilized the FETCH api to fetch local json data. I'm not 100% sure how this works still so I need to look more into it
-Utilized !important command in CSS to override the inline properties I made from javascript
