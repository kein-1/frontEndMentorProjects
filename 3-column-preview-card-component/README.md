## My process

-Wasn't too bad. Had some issues with media queries but other than that it was good
-I wrapped the grid container around a flexbox div to center my container

### Built with

HTML,CSS,JS

-When I used height: auto for mobile design, it worked. But if I used height: 100vh;
it did not work for mobile
